# ThreadOS File System - CSS430 Final Project

This is an implementation of a working file system in Java for UW's ThreadOS. It emulates a UNIX file system with minor differences by implementing inodes, superblocks, file tables and entries, and other components. It is able to allocate and deallocate space, create a virtual directory, and handles active readers and/or writers accordingly.
